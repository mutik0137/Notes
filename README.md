## Comments

Commentary is a necessary evil

Comments are always failures. We must have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them, but their use is not a cause for celebration. The ideal situation is when your code doesn't need comments. We must strive for this.

However, some comments are necessary or beneficial. Keep in mind, that the only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write.

### Good comments
* Legal comments

```javascript
// Copyright (C) 2003,2004,2005 by Object Mentor, Inc. All rights reserved.
// Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.
```

Comments like this should not be contracts or legal tomes. Where possible, refer to a standard license or other external document rather than putting all the terms and conditions into the comment

* Informative comments

```javascript
// format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
const timeMatcher = Pattern.compile("\\d*:\\d*:\\d* \\w*, \\w* \\d*, \\d*");
```

In this case the comment lets us know that the regular expression is intended to match a time and date. Still, it might have been better, and clearer, if this code had been moved to a special class that converted the formats of dates and times. Then the comment would likely have been superfluous.

* Expression of intent

```C++
//This is our best attempt to get a race condition 
//by creating large number of threads. 
for (int i = 0; i < 25000; i++) { 
  WidgetBuilderThread widgetBuilderThread = new WidgetBuilderThread(widgetBuilder, text, parent, failFlag); 
  Thread thread = new Thread(widgetBuilderThread); 
  thread.start(); 
}
```

You might not agree with the programmerâ€™s solution to the problem, but at least you know what he was trying to do.

* Warning of consequences

```javascript
// Don't run unless you
// have some time to kill.
function _testWithReallyBigFile() {
  res.send(reallyBigFile);
}
```

* TODO comments

### Bad comments
List of bad comments may be to long. Just know that if you still had to write a comment, it should not be:
* Mumbling
* Redundant comments
* Misleading comments
* Mandated comments (like "function must have a javadoc")
* Position markers
* Closing brace comments 
* and such bullshit

**Make clear code**
